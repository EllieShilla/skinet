### Description
###### The concept of the online store. 
###### The visitor has the following features: view all products, go to a page and view detailed information about the product, sort products, add them to the cart, register, log in, place orders followed by payment card, view orders.
###### I made the site based on the course https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-build-an-e-commerce-app-with-net-core-and-angular/. 
###### In the course the payment system was Stripe. Since the Stripe payment system is not available in my country, I used LiqPay.
